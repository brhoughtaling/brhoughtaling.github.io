    <h2>Supplements</h2>
    <p style="border: thin solid black;"> 
      Workout supplements are compounds of vitamins, nutrients, and nootropics used to maximize focus, endurance, and protein synthesis. Also, just to clarify, I will only be discussing natural supplements. There is a common misconception that it is achievable for a six foot male to be 210 pounds and absolutely shredded, but unless you have insane genetics, this is not possible. There are many famous influencers who claim to be natural but actually use performance enhancing drugs such as testosterone boosters, SARMS, or even steroids. These drugs boost protein synthesis and speed up recovery to a point at which the body cannot normally maintain. These drugs/ non natural supplements are dangerous and can throw the body out of homeostasis and even cause organ failure or death. On the other hand, the natural supplements I am talking about are naturally occurring in the body and will not throw the body out of homeostasis. There are two main categories of natural supplements, pre and post workout. As I have already stated pre workout is taken before your workout which stimulates the brain and increases blood flow in order to maximize endurance. Post- workout is taken after your workout which increases protein synthesis in order to maximize strength and recovery. Below I will list some of my favorite per and post workouts:
